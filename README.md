# JohnsonChain-DeFi-Platform
Johnson DeFi Platform is a decentralized finance application built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to stake ERC20 tokens, earn passive rewards, and interact with smart contracts in a secure and transparent environment. The project focuses on clean architecture, smart contract security, and seamless Web3 integration. It is designed to demonstrate real-world DeFi use cases including staking, reward distribution, and wallet-based authentication. This project is intended for learning, experimentation, and future production-grade extension.
